# Jetlag App
Productivity Tool to help combat jetlag when traveling or in every day life.

## Backed by the latest in science.
The foundation of this application is peer reviewed science. All mechanisms and tools explained is backed by current scientific literature.

## Sleep
- What is sleep?

- What determines how well we sleep and the quality of our wakeful state?
This is determined by two forces. Adenosine & the circadian rythmn

Adenosine is a molecule that builds up in our nervous system, the longer we are awake.
When adenosine is low, we are alert. When adenosine is high, we want to fall asleep.

Although, for those that pull all nighters you will notice that at a certain point the sleepiness will go away. This is because of the second force, the circadian force which resides in all humans and animals. It determines when we want to be awake and sleepy. The cycle is typically broken down into 6-10 hour blocks of wakefulness or sleepiness.

Sleeping on a consistent schedule is the most important thing one can do to maintain a healthy life. Lack of sleep contributes to an increase in all cause mortality.
Travel causes fatigue. Even traveling north and south within the same time zone causes fatigue.
Mental and physical output both suffer from lack of sleep.

## Light
Light is the most important factor for when you want to sleep.

When we wake up, adenosine levels tend to be low. Our system generates an internal signal (hormone - a chemical that is released from one organ and acts on other organs elsewhere, including your nervous system)
- Wakefulness Signal
You wake up because pulses of cortisol & epinephrine are released from your adrenal glands & your brain. It's a signal to your whole body to increase your heart rate, tensing your muscles, and moving about. It is important that this cortisol pulse comes early in your period of wakefulness. This is a healthy reaction that starts your day.
This also sets off a timer (12-14 hours) in your brain that dictates when another hormone, melatonin, which makes you sleepy, will be released from your pineal gland.
- Sleepiness Signal
Melatonin is only released 12-14 hours after your cortisol pulse. 

The wakefulness & sleepiness signals are endogenous systems, both hormonal and neural. External factors can govern when they take place. Light is the most powerful external factor that affects these signals. 

There are a type of melanopsin retinal ganglion cells that perceive a particualr type of light and communicates that to this clock that resides right above the roof of your mouth, called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.

The suprachiasmatic nucleus has connections with every cell and organ in your body. Getting light communicated to the suprachiasmatic nucleus is so important because there are tremendously broad and bad effects on the cardiovascular health, dementia, metabolic effects, learning, depression, dementia, etc. 

The neurons in our eyes, that set the circadian clock and then allow our circadian clock to set all the clocks of all the cells and organs and tissues of our body, best responds to a particular quality and quantity of light that comes from the sun. When the sun is at a low solar angle, (sunrise, sunset) is what our eyes and the nervous system are "looking for". It is the contrast in yellow and blue light, that triggers the activation of these cells. 

* It is important to note that the eyes don't know what a sunrise, sunset, artificial light, or natural light are. They just best respond to the quality and amount of light that comes from the sun when it is low in the sky.

So get outside and get sunlight into your eyes!

## High Solar Angle
Once the sun is high overhead, the quality of light shifts, so that you miss the opportunity to time the cortisol pulse. Timing your cortisol pulse properly is vitally important. A late shifted cortisol pulse (8pm - 9pm) is a signature of a lot of anxiety disorders and depression. Whether it is correlated, the cause, or the effect is still unknown. Bringing that cortisol pulse earlier in the day has many positive effects, particularly for mental health.

## Light Sensitivity
Early in the day, your retina is not very sensitive to light. Which means you need a lot of it to set your your clock mechanisms. Do not gaze at the sun without blinking, ignoring that reflex can result in the burning of your retina. You can still get light photons in your eyes without staring directly at the sun.
Sunlight inhibits the pineal gland from releasing melatonin. This suppresses the feeling of sleepiness.

## Light Viewing Protocol
2 - 10 minutes of sunlight exposure.
Seeing the sun is not needed. What triggers the melanopsin retinal ganglion cells are the wavelengths of light present int the atmosphere, even through cloud cover.

## Importance of Light Viewing
Viewing sunlight is 1,000 - 10,000 times more effective than exercising in darkness or adjusting your food intake timing.

## Secondary Circadian Rythmn Setting
There is a second structure in the brain called the intergeniculate-leaflet that regulates our clock through non photic type influences like feeding and exercising.
Eating & exercising earlier along with viewing light in the morning will shift our clocks earlier. 

- Feeding Timing 

- Exercise Timing

## Anchoring our Clock to a Good Routine
Sunrise viewing is the main way to setting the clock and keeping it anchored.
Sunset viewing signals to the melanopsin retinal ganglion cells that it is the end of the day. This prevents some of the negative effects of light viewing at night, that prevents melatonin release later that same night. 
Every cell in your body needs light information and these are the only two ways we can get it.

## Wakefulness and Light Sensitivity
Light is not supposed to arrive in our system at any time. The longer you are awake, the more sensitive your retina are to the light. If you're awake for 12-16 hours it is very easy for even a small amount of light to trigger the activation of the clock and make you feel like you want to stay up later and disrupt your sleeping pattern.

## One of One
This App can only give you an estimation of time needed to shift your circadian rythmn. Every human is unique. There is no one measurement that works for every single human. There are a range of melatonin receptors, metabolic types, genetic histories, etc. By understanding the mechanisms, you have greater control on the processes that get you a good night's rest.

## Melatonin
Melatonin comes from Seratonin, a neurotransmitter. It stimulates stillness, the opposite of what dopamine does, which stimulates action.

### Circadian Rythmn (24 Hour Cycle)
- Body temperature goes from low -> high -> low
- Sleepiness and wakefulness is correlates with temperature minimum and maximum.
- Supracharismatic Nucleus is the internal clock that sets the rythmn.
- Genes in every cell of our body that follow a 24 hour rythmn.
- Matches 24 hour light/dark cycle
- Our cells, organs, wakefulness, temperature, immune system, all of it, is tied to the outside light/dark cycle.

### Humans are diurnal species
Awake during the daytime and asleep at night.

# Ideal Cycle
- As much light as possible when you want to be awake.
- As little light as possible when you want to be sleeping.
What is too bright?
When it's painful to look at. 
- Get 100,000 lux before 9am.
- Must be done with your eyes. 
	- Artificial light might not sum up to 100,000 lux before 9:00am.
	- THE LIGHT HAS TO BE CAPTURED AND SUMMED BEFORE YOU REACH YOUR CYRCADIAN DEAD ZONE
	- A lot of photon energy is needed to start the clock in the morning. 
	- A little bit of photon energy can reset and shift your clock after 8pm.
	- Avoid bright ligjts between 10:00pm - 4:00am

## Jetlag
 - Jetlag will lead to an earlier death. Why?
	- The autonomic nervous system, the set of neurons in our spinal cord, body, and brain, regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. 
	- Human beings are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. 
- Traveling west is always easier than traveling east.
	- If you are traveling from California to New York, you have to get to bed 3 hours earlier and wake up 3 hours earlier. It is a lot harder to do this as opposed to staying up 3 hours later and going to bed 3 hours later. 
	- This is probably due to evolutionary adaptation, where the need to get up and go, forage for food, fight, or do any number of things were done with the release of adrenaline and epinephrine. 
	- This asymmetry in our autonomic nervous system plays out in the asymmetry of jetlag. 
	
### Travel Fatigue & Timezone Jetlag
- Timezone Jetlag: The inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match your internal rythmn.

## Temperature Minimum
TEMP MIN IS A REFERENCE POINT NOT A TEMP READING
No thermometer is needed. Temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is at it's lowest.
90 minutes prior to waking up is your temp min.
Ex. 
	Wakeup time : 5:30am
	Temp Min: 3:30am -4:00am

There are things that can disrupt your temperature pattern like meals, sauna, exercise, etc. 

Temperature signals are the one unifying signal to follow a set pattern.

Take the last 3-5 wakeup times and averaging them. 
* Temp Min = Add Wakeup Times / Days Tracked 

### Phase Advance
Exposing your eyes to bright light in the 4 hours after your temperature minimum will make you wake up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days.
The same goes for exercise.

### Phase Delay
Exposing your eyes to bright lights 4 hours before your temp min will make you wake up later and go to sleep later. 
The same goes for exercise.

### Insomnia
Sleepiness during the daytime is a sign of insomnia. The exception to this around your temperature peak. If you feel tired for around 90 mins or around your temperature peak, it is normal.

### Fatigue
Physical exhaustion

## Traveling West
California -> Europe
9 Hour difference
Temp min: 8:00am
- Start waking up at around 8:30am
- Bright light exposure / natural or artificial
- Exercise 
- Eat
Start protocol 2-3 days before travel because once you land in Europe chances are viewing the sun rise or sun set is not going to allow me to shift my circadian clock because of my circadian dead zone or end up viewing sunlight at a time that correspondss to the 4 - 6 hour window before my temperature minimum (which will make me stay up & go to bed later, not earlier).

This allows you to shift 1-3 hours per day. With the example above you can phase advance your clock in a 24-36 hour span. 

You must keep track of your temp minimum back home and how it's being shifted. This allows you to keep track of things like your circadian dead zone. 

Eat within the local schedule for alertness. Don't stay on your home meal schedule. It will throw your schedule out of wack because a lot of the clocks in the periphery ie. liver, will send information back to the brain that is conflicting with your rythmn.

## Traveling East
Europe -> California
Easier to do when tired at 4pm. 
View sunlight around 6-8pm 
Caffine
Exercise 
Doing these things after your temp max will help you stay up later.

If trip is 3 days or less try to stay on your home schedule.

Circadian Deadzone 10am - 3pm * Rising temp to max

* Danger - If you view a lot of light during the 4-6 hours before your temp min, it will phase advance your clock pretty considerably. 


Temp decreasing -> avoid light -> phase delay clock
Temp increasing -> get light -> phase advance clock
