 * ! Always store the datetime in UTC time zone.
 * ! While displaying the datetime to the user, convert it to their local time zone at the application layer.
 * ! Never use timestamps to store past or future.
 * ! Try to use datetime format instead of timestamps as it makes visual debugging easy. With timestamp, you have to convert from seconds to date but datetime is like a string. So, if you find yourself accessing the raw values for debugging, then try to use datetime.
